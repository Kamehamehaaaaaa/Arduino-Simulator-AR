# Arduino-Simulator-AR
An android app to study different connections of Arduino using Augmented Reality

**Project Description:**
This project aims to create a proactive Arduino simulation application that uses augmented reality to project the Arduino board midair or on a plane surface. We have used Unity 3D for interfacing all of the components, AR, and UI/UX in an Android application.
